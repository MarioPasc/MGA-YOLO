# MGA-YOLO Change Log (session summary)

## Added / Created

- `configs/models/yolov8_mga.yaml`
  - Added custom MGA architecture YAML (initial YOLO11-style then adapted to YOLOv8-style by user) introducing placeholder MGA components (`MGAMaskHead`, planned `MGAAttention`) and integrating them at P3/P4/P5 feature levels.
  - Goal: Provide a declarative model definition to extend baseline YOLO with mask-guided attention pipeline and per-scale mask heads.

- `mga_yolo/nn/modules/segmentation.py`
  - Implemented `MGAMaskHead` module (config dataclass + lightweight Conv->Norm->Act->Dropout->Conv head) producing coarse per-scale mask logits.
  - Goal: Supply a reusable, typed, easily extensible segmentation head for FPN scales (P3/P4/P5) to support mask-guided attention and future loss integration.

- `mga_yolo/nn/modules/__init__.py`
  - Added logging setup (`LOGGER`) for MGA segmentation namespace and later extended to expose custom modules.
  - Goal: Centralize debug logging for custom MGA components.

- `mga_yolo/utils/dataloader.py`
  - Added thin wrapper `build_dataloader` with debug logging hook.
  - Goal: Allow future custom sampling / curriculum logic while keeping current behavior identical to Ultralytics default.

- `mga_yolo/engine/train.py`
  - Added CLI training entrypoint wrapping Ultralytics `YOLO` to ensure MGA modules are imported before model instantiation.
  - Goal: Simplify launching training with custom MGA YAML and dataset configuration.

## Modified

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/models/yolo/model.py`
  - Inserted auto-detection path for model filenames containing "mga" to load via standard YOLO initialization without altering core task map.
  - Goal: Seamless instantiation of MGA YAML architectures without creating a separate high-level model class.

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/nn/modules/__init__.py`
  - Appended try/except import of `MGAMaskHead` so YAML parser can resolve the custom layer name.
  - Goal: Register custom MGA module within Ultralytics module namespace for YAML-driven model building.

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/data/dataset.py`
  - Added logic to: (1) infer per-image mask path from dataset root + `masks_dir`, (2) load grayscale mask, (3) perform naive stride-based downsampling for P3/P4/P5 (8/16/32) using nearest resize, (4) attach list `masks_multi` to each sample, (5) extend `collate_fn` to pad & stack multi-scale masks, (6) added helper methods `_infer_mask_path` and `_downsample_mask`, required imports (`math`, `torch.nn.functional as F`).
  - Goal: Provide training batches with multi-scale coarse masks aligned to detection feature map scales for future segmentation loss / attention.
  - NOTE: Current downsampling is a placeholder; will be replaced with connectivity-preserving method (`downsample_preserve_connectivity`) in a subsequent change per user request.

## Intent / Pending (not yet implemented in code above)

- Replace naive mask downsampling with connectivity-preserving algorithm from `mga_yolo/utils/mask_downsample.py`.
- Implement `MGAAttention` and potential fused detection+segmentation loss integration.
- Add segmentation loss computation using `masks_multi` inside training loop.

## Rationale Summary

These changes establish the structural scaffolding for MGA-YOLO: a declarative model spec, a custom mask generation head, dataset pipeline support for coarse masks, and registration/initialization paths so Ultralytics core can construct and train the extended architecture with minimal disruption. Further steps will integrate advanced downsampling, attention modules, and losses.
