# MGA-YOLO Change Log (session summary)

## Added / Created

- `configs/models/yolov8_mga.yaml`
  - Added custom MGA architecture YAML (initial YOLO11-style then adapted to YOLOv8-style by user) introducing placeholder MGA components (`MGAMaskHead`, planned `MGAAttention`) and integrating them at P3/P4/P5 feature levels.
  - Goal: Provide a declarative model definition to extend baseline YOLO with mask-guided attention pipeline and per-scale mask heads.

- `mga_yolo/nn/modules/segmentation.py`
  - Implemented `MGAMaskHead` module (config dataclass + lightweight Conv->Norm->Act->Dropout->Conv head) producing coarse per-scale mask logits.
  - Goal: Supply a reusable, typed, easily extensible segmentation head for FPN scales (P3/P4/P5) to support mask-guided attention and future loss integration.

- `mga_yolo/nn/modules/__init__.py`
  - Added logging setup (`LOGGER`) for MGA segmentation namespace and later extended to expose custom modules.
  - Goal: Centralize debug logging for custom MGA components.

- `mga_yolo/utils/dataloader.py`
  - Added thin wrapper `build_dataloader` with debug logging hook.
  - Goal: Allow future custom sampling / curriculum logic while keeping current behavior identical to Ultralytics default.

- `mga_yolo/engine/train.py`
  - Added CLI training entrypoint wrapping Ultralytics `YOLO` to ensure MGA modules are imported before model instantiation.
  - Goal: Simplify launching training with custom MGA YAML and dataset configuration.

- `mga_yolo/engine/model.py`, `mga_yolo/engine/predict.py`, `mga_yolo/engine/val.py`
  - Introduced `MGAModel` (subclass of `DetectionModel`) returning a dict `{det: ..., seg: {...}}` with raw per-scale mask logits plus detection output.
  - Added `MGAPredictor` attaching `mga_masks` dict to each `Results` object and `MGAValidator` ignoring segmentation masks for current metrics.
  - Goal: Provide a native end-to-end forward path without reliance on forward hooks.

- `mga_yolo/nn/losses/segmentation.py`
  - Implemented multi-scale segmentation loss (`SegmentationLoss`) combining BCE-with-logits and soft Dice per scale (P3/P4/P5) with configurable weights (`SegLossConfig`).
  - Goal: Enable integration of coarse mask supervision into total training loss via `MGATrainer`.

- `tests_mga/test_mga_basic.py`, `tests_mga/test_mga_train.py`
  - Added smoke tests for: (a) model build & forward dict outputs (3 mask scales), (b) prediction path producing `mga_masks`, (c) synthetic dataset creator (future 1-epoch training smoke â€“ currently minimal and may require installing `numpy`, `opencv-python`).
  - Goal: Establish an initial regression harness for MGA functionality.

## Modified

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/models/yolo/model.py`
  - Added automatic task override (`task='mga'`) when model filename (or YAML content) indicates MGA usage ("mga" in stem or presence of `MGAMaskHead`).
  - Extended `task_map` with an `mga` entry referencing `MGAModel`, `MGATrainer`, `MGAPredictor`, `MGAValidator`.
  - NOTE: Current iterative edits introduced circular import/initialization issues causing `from ultralytics import YOLO` to fail; planned resolution is to revert most invasive changes and re-apply a minimal, low-risk task injection (see Pending section below).

- `mga_yolo/engine/train.py`
  - Extended to initialize and aggregate segmentation losses (`SegmentationLoss`) alongside standard detection loss (BCE + Dice per scale + global weighting) producing extra loss item logging keys: `p3_bce`, `p3_dice`, `p4_bce`, `p4_dice`, `p5_bce`, `p5_dice`, `seg_total`.
  - Goal: Fuse segmentation supervision into training loop transparently.

- `mga_yolo/engine/model.py`
  - Tweaked forward pass implementation to always return dict and simplify stored outputs while collecting mask logits by layer index.
  - Goal: Provide stable contract for downstream trainer/predictor.

- (Planned fix not yet applied) `ultralytics/ultralytics/data/dataset.py`
  - Identified duplicate `__getitem__` definition shadowing mask-loading logic; pending clean-up to ensure only enhanced version with `masks_multi` assembly remains (will finalize in next iteration).

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/nn/modules/__init__.py`
  - Appended try/except import of `MGAMaskHead` so YAML parser can resolve the custom layer name.
  - Goal: Register custom MGA module within Ultralytics module namespace for YAML-driven model building.

- `ultralytics/ultralytics/data/dataset.py`
  - Added logic to: (1) infer per-image mask path from dataset root + `masks_dir`, (2) load grayscale mask, (3) perform naive stride-based downsampling for P3/P4/P5 (8/16/32) using nearest resize, (4) attach list `masks_multi` to each sample, (5) extend `collate_fn` to pad & stack multi-scale masks, (6) added helper methods `_infer_mask_path` and `_downsample_mask`, required imports (`math`, `torch.nn.functional as F`).
  - Goal: Provide training batches with multi-scale coarse masks aligned to detection feature map scales for future segmentation loss / attention.
  - NOTE: Current downsampling is a placeholder; will be replaced with connectivity-preserving method (`downsample_preserve_connectivity`) in a subsequent change per user request.

## Intent / Pending (not yet implemented in code above)

- Implement `MGAAttention` and potential fused detection+segmentation loss integration.
- Add segmentation loss computation using `masks_multi` inside training loop.
  (Partially implemented now via `SegmentationLoss`; next step: verify with real dataset & add segmentation metrics such as per-scale Dice/mIoU.)
- Resolve circular import introduced by extensive edits in `yolo/model.py` by reverting to upstream base and applying a minimal MGA task hook (safer path) OR refactoring remaining `yolo.*` references to lazy local imports.
- Remove obsolete duplicate dataset `__getitem__` and finalize connectivity-preserving downsampling integration.
